### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am new to GitHub and eager to develop my data skills.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics in Python, SQL and Tableau
- ðŸŒ³ When I am ready, I will use my knowledge to provide organizations with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions
- ðŸš€ In doing so, my focus will be on human resources
- ðŸŒ” My goal is to implement strategic as well as scalable measures in organizations to lead decisions away from an emotional and towards a substantive level
